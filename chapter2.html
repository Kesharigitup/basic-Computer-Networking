    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO TOPOLOGY</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt style="color:red ;">What is topology?</dt>
        <dd>The arrangement of network that comparies nodes and connection lines via sender and receiver is referred to as network topology. 
                                      In the other word ,the pictorial represent of computer network is called network topology.         
        </dd>
    
    <h4>types of topology:-</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Mesh topology</li>
            <li>Ring topology</li>
            <li>Star topology</li>
            <li> Bus topology</li>
            <li>Tree topology</li>
            <li>Hybrid  topology</li>
         </ol>
         
            <dt style="color: blue;">1.Mesh topology </dt>
            <dd>A mesh topology is a network setup where each computer and network device is interconnected with one another. 
                This topology setup allows for most transmissions to be distributed even if one of the connections goes down.
                 It is a topology commonly used for wireless networks. Below is a visual example of a simple computer setup on
                  a network using a mesh topology.
            </dd>
            <h4>Advantage:-</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Each connection can carry its own data load  </li>
                <li>It is robust </li>
                <li>Fault is diagnosed easily</li>
                <li>Provides security and privacy</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantage:-</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Installation and configuration is difficult</li>
                <li>Cabling cost is more</li>
                <li> Bulk wiring is required</li>
            </ul>

<dt style="color:blue ;">2.Ring topology:-</dt>
<dd>A ring topology is a network configuration where device connections create a circular data path.
     Each networked device is connected to two others, like points on a circle. Together, devices in
      a ring topology are referred to as a ring network.A ring topology is a network configuration where 
      device connections create a circular data path. Each networked device is connected to two others, like points on a circle.
       Together, devices in a ring topology are referred to as a ring network.</dd>
       <h4>Advantage:-</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>The possibility of collision minimum in this type of topology</li>
        <li>Cheap to install and expand</li>
        
       </ul>
       <h4>Disadvantage:-</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>troubleshooting is difficult in this topology</li>
        <li>The addition of stations in b/w or removel of station can disturb the whole topology</li>
        <li>Less secure</li>
       </ul>
       <img src="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/ring.gif " alt="image" text-align="center" >
       <dt style="color:blue ;">3.star topology:-</dt>
<dd>Star topology is a network topology in which each network component is physically connected to a
     central node such as a router, hub or switch.
                       In a star topology, the central hub acts like a server and the connecting nodes act like clients.
      When the central node receives a packet from a connecting node, it can pass the packet on to other 
      nodes in the network. A star topology is also known as a star network.</dd>
      <h4>Advantage:-</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Less expensive because each device only need one I/O port and wishes to be connected with hub with one link.</li>
        <li>Easy fault detection because the link are often easily identified.</li>
        <li>No disruptions to the network when connecting or removing devices.</li>
        <li>It is high-performing as no data collisions can occur</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Disadvantage:-</h4>
      <ul>
        
        <li>Requires more cable than a linear bus</li>
        <li>More expensive than linear bus topology due to the value of the connecting devices (network switches)</li>
        <li>Hub requires more resources and regular maintenance because itâ€™s the central system of star .</li>
        <li>Extra hardware is required (hubs or switches) which adds to cost</li>
      </ul>

      <dt style="color: blue;">4.Bus topology:-</dt>
      <dd>Bus topology is a specific kind of network topology in which all of the various devices in the network are connected
         to a single cable or line. In general, the term refers to how various devices are set up in a network.</dd>
         <h4>Advantage:-</h4>
         <ul>
        <li>It works very efficiently well when there is a small network.</li>
        <li>The length of cable required is less than a star topology.</li>
        <li>It is easy to connect or remove devices in this network without affecting any other device.</li>
        <li>Easy to expand by joining the two cables together.</li>
        <li>It is easy to understand topology.</li>
     </ul>



         <h4>Disadvantage:-</h4>
         <ul>
           
           <li>Bus topology is not great for large networks.</li>
           <li>Identification of problems becomes difficult if the whole network goes down</li>
           <li>Need terminators are required at both ends of the main cable</li>
           <li>This network topology is very slow as compared to other topologies.</li>
         </ul>

<dt style="color: blue;">5.Tree topology:-</dt>
<dd>A tree topology is a type of network topology that includes at least three specific levels in a topology hierarchy.
     Tree topologies are valued for their scalability and accessibility for troubleshooting.</dd>
     <h4>Advantage:-</h4>
     <ul>
    <li>The other nodes in a network are not affected if one of their nodes gets damaged or does not work.</li>
    <li>Tree topology provides easy maintenance and easy fault identification can be done.</li>
    <li>A callable topology. Leaf nodes can hold more nodes.</li>
    <li>This topology is the combination of bus and star topology.</li>
    <li>Tree Topology is reliable.</li>
 </ul>



     <h4>Disadvantage:-</h4>
     <ul>
       
       <li>This network is very difficult to configure as compared to the other network topologies.</li>
       <li>Treatment of the topology is pretty complex.</li>
       <li>Requires a large number of cables compared to star and ring topology.</li>
       <li>The length of a segment is limited & the limit of the segment depends on the type of cabling used.</li>
     </ul>

     <dt style="color: blue;">6.Hybrid topology:-</dt>
     <dd>A hybrid topology is a type of network topology that uses two or more differing network topologies. 
        These topologies can include a mix of bus topology, mesh topology, ring topology, star topology, and tree topology.</dd>
        <h4>Advantage:-</h4>
        <ul>
       <li>It is extremely flexible.</li>
       <li>It is very reliable.</li>
       <li>It is easily scalable as Hybrid networks are built in a fashion which
         enables easy integration of new hardware components.</li>
       <li>Error detecting and troubleshooting are easy.</li>
       <li>The speed of the topology becomes fast when two topologies are put together.</li>
       <li>It is used to create large networks.</li>
    </ul>



        <h4>Disadvantage:-</h4>
        <ul>
          
          <li>It is a type of network expensive.</li>
          <li>The design of a hybrid network is very complex.</li>
          <li>There is a change in the hardware to connect one topology with another topology.</li>
          <li>Installation is a difficult process.</li>
