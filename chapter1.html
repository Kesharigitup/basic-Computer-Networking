    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER NETWORKING</h1>
   
<dl>
  <dt style="color: red;"> 1.What do you mean by information technology ?</dt> 
    <dd>Ans:-Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, 
        infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically,
         IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to technology used for personal or entertainment purposes.
          The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.

        The Harvard Business Review coined the term information technology to make a distinction between purpose-built machines 
        designed to perform a limited scope of functions, and general-purpose computing machines that could be programmed for
         various tasks. As the IT industry evolved from the mid-20th century, computing capability increased, while device cost
          and energy consumption decreased, a cycle that continues today when new technologies emerge.</dd>
    
        <dt style="color: red;">2.Role of computer network in information technology.</dt>
        <dd>Ans:-It is a branch ofinformation technology in which we study the process of building ,using and maintaining 
 computer network,including hardware,software and protocols.So ,that multiple device share data.it is a system of 
 connected in computing device and share information and resource between them.  </dd>

        <dt style="color: red;">3.Why do we study computer network ? </dt>
        <dd>Ans:-In today’s technology-oriented world, sharing has become an integral part of businesses and other activities.
      This sharing can be achieved by networking. A computer network is linking two or more computers in order to share 
    files or resources.

Here, we will see why we need computer networks in more detail below −
            
         <h4> To share computer files:-</h4>  
            Networks enable users to share files with others. For example, in a company, one file is to be 
            
shared by multiple branches. When we locate this file on the network system, all the branches can use this file.
            
           <h4> To share computer equipment:-</h4> 
            Laser printers and large hard-disk drives can be expensive. Networks enable users to share such equipment by networking           
 microcomputers or workstations together.
            
<h4>To enable unlike computer equipment to communicate:-</h4> 
 A company with computers of multiple uses using several operating systems, including MS-DOS, UNIX, 
WINDOWS 95, and Apple DOS, cannot share files from one computer to another unless arranged using a 
 Networking operating system including Network 4.1 or Windows NT 4.0.
            
           <h4>To improve communication speed and accuracy:-</h4> 
 Sending messages through networks is virtually instantaneous, and there is also less chance of a message being lost.
            
           <h4>To reduce the cost of data transfer:-</h4> 
 The cost of transfers of files using computers associated with networks is less expensive than other
 traditional means like telegrams.
            
         <h4> Verify Data Transfer:-</h4>  
 Fluctuations of costs in foreign exchange and shares can be broadcasted promptly using the channel of computer communications. 
 The transmission can be increased and checked at any occurrence of time.
            
          <h4> High Reliability:-</h4> 
 All files can be recreated on a few machines, and therefore if one of them is unavailable (because of hardware failure),
 the different copies can be used.</dd>
   
            <dt style="color:red ;">4.what is computer network?</dt>
            <dd>Ans:-it is a group of computers which are connected each other and follow similar usase protocol for 
    the purpose sharing sharing information and having communication provide 
     by the networking nodes is called a computer network.
                                           A network may be small where it include just one system or may as large as what one may want
     ,the  nodes may further be classified  into various types.
 <h4>These inlude :-</h4>

    <li>Personal computer</li>
    <li>Servers</li>
    <li>Networking hardware</li>
    <li>General hots</li>
</ul> 
 <h4> Networking can be classified into three type:-  </h4>

    <li>Topology</li>
    <li>Interpretes</li>

    <li>LAN</li>
    <li>WAN</li>
    <li>WLAN</li>
    <li>CAN</li>
