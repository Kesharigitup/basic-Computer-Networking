    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO OSI MODEL</h1>
    <h4 style="color: red;">    OSI model:-</h4>
    <ul>
<li>OSI stands for Open System Interconnection is a reference model that describes how information from a software
    application in one computer
    moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.</li>
<li>OSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a particular network function.</li>
<li>OSI model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984,
     and it is now considered as an architectural model for the inter-computer communications.</li>
<li>OSI model divides the whole task into seven smaller and manageable tasks. Each layer is assigned a particular task.</li>
<li>Each layer is self-contained, so that task assigned to each layer can be performed independently.</li>
    </ul>

<dl>
<dt>Application Layer:-</dt>
<dd>The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. It provides protocols that 
    allow software to send and receive information and present meaningful data to users. A few examples of application
     layer protocols are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), 
     Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).</dd>

     <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/images/application_layer.jpg" alt="" >
     <dt>Presentation Layer:-</dt>
     <dd>The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt,
         and compress data so it is received correctly on the other end. The presentation layer takes any data transmitted
          by the application layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer.</dd>

          <dt>Session layer:-</dt>
          <dd>The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices. It is responsible for
             opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when
              communication ends. The session layer can also set checkpoints during a data transfer—if the session is interrupted,
               devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint.</dd>

               <dt>Transport Layer:-</dt>
               <dd>The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end. 
                It is responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the 
                session layer. The transport layer carries out flow control, sending data at a rate that matches the connection speed 
                of the receiving device, and error control, checking if data was received incorrectly and if not, requesting it again.</dd>

<dt>Network Layer:-</dt> 
<dd>The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the
     receiving end. The other is routing packets by discovering the best path across a physical network. The network layer uses 
     network addresses (typically Internet Protocol addresses) to route packets to a destination node.</dd>

     <dt>Data-Link Layer:-</dt    
     <dd>The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network.
         It breaks up packets into frames and sends them from source to destination. This layer is composed of 
         two parts—Logical Link Control (LLC), which identifies network protocols, performs error checking and
          synchronizes frames, and Media Access Control (MAC) which uses MAC addresses to connect devices and
           define permissions to transmit and receive data.</dd>dd>

           <dt>Physical Layer:-</dt> 
           <dd>The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes.
             It defines the connector, the electrical cable or wireless technology connecting the devices, and is 
             responsible for transmission of the raw data, which is simply a series of 0s and 1s, while taking care 
             of bit rate control.</dd>

             <h3>Advantages of OSI Model:-</h3>
             <h4>The OSI model helps users and operators of computer networks:</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>Determine the required hardware and software to build their network.</li>
                <li>Understand and communicate the process followed by components communicating across a network</li>
                <li>Perform troubleshooting, by identifying which network layer is causing an issue and focusing efforts on that layer.</li>
             </ul>
<h4>The OSI model helps network device manufacturers and networking software vendors:</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>Create devices and software that can communicate with products from any other vendor, allowing open interoperability</li>
                <li>Define which parts of the network their products should work with.</li>
                <li>Communicate to users at which network layers their product operates – for example,
                     only at the application layer, or across the stack.</li>
             </ul>
</dl>
<h2>Ethernet:-</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ethernet is the traditional technology for connecting devices in a wired local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). 
        It enables devices to communicate with each other via a protocol, which is a set of rules or common network language.</li>
    <li>Ethernet describes how network devices format and transmit data so other devices on the same LAN or campus
         network can recognize, receive and process the information. An Ethernet cable is the physical,
          encased wiring over which the data travels.</li>
    <li>Connected devices that use cables to access a geographically localized network -- instead of 
        a wireless connection -- likely use Ethernet. From businesses to gamers, diverse end users rely
         on the benefits of Ethernet connectivity, which include reliability and security.</li>
    <li>Compared to wireless LAN (WLAN) technology, Ethernet is typically less vulnerable to disruptions.
         It can also offer a greater degree of network security and control than wireless technology because 
         devices must connect using physical cabling. This makes it difficult for outsiders to access network 
         data or hijack bandwidth for unsanctioned devices.</li>
